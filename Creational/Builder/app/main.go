// The Builder pattern is used when the desired product is complex and requires multiple steps to complete.
// In this case, several construction methods would be simpler than a single monstrous constructor.
// The potential problem with the multistage building process is that a partially built and unstable product
// may be exposed to the client. The Builder pattern keeps the product private until itâ€™s fully built.

// In the below code, we see different types of houses (igloo and normalHouse) being constructed by iglooBuilder
// and normalBuilder. Each house type has the same construction steps. The optional director struct helps to
// organize the building process.
